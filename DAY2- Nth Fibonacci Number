Problem Statement:

The n-th term of the Fibonacci series F(n), where F(n) is a function, is calculated using the following formula:
F(n)=F(n−1)+F(n−2)
Where:
F(1) = 1
F(2) Code:

CODE:

from math import *
from collections import *
from sys import *
from os import *

def fib(n):
    # Handle base cases
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1 or n == 2:
        return 1
    
    # Initialize first two numbers
    prev2 = 1  # F(1)
    prev1 = 1  # F(2)
    current = 0
    
    # Calculate Fibonacci number iteratively
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        current = prev1 + prev2
        prev2 = prev1
        prev1 = current
    
    return current

# For testing
def main():
    # Handle input
    n = int(input())
    print(fib(n))
