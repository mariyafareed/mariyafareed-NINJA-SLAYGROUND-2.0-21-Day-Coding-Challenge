PROBLEM STATEMENT:
You have been given an array/list 'arr' consisting of 'n' elements.
Each element in the array is either 0, 1 or 2.
Sort this array/list in increasing order.
Do not make a new array/list. Make changes in the given array/list.

code:
from os import *
from sys import *
from collections import *
from math import *

def sortArray(arr, n):
    # Initialize three pointers: low, mid, and high
    low, mid, high = 0, 0, n - 1

    # Traverse the array until mid <= high
    while mid <= high:
        if arr[mid] == 0:
            # Swap arr[low] and arr[mid], increment both low and mid
            arr[low], arr[mid] = arr[mid], arr[low]
            low += 1
            mid += 1
        elif arr[mid] == 1:
            # Move the mid pointer if the value is 1
            mid += 1
        else:  # arr[mid] == 2
            # Swap arr[mid] and arr[high], decrement high
            arr[mid], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[mid]
            high -= 1
