# Problem Statement:

Programming languages have conditional/decision-making statements that execute when a specific condition is met.

**Switch-case** is one of the ways to implement these conditions.

In a menu-driven program, the user is given a set of choices (the menu) and is asked to select an option.

There are **2 choices** in the menu:

1. **Choice 1**: Find the area of a circle with radius `r`.
2. **Choice 2**: Find the area of a rectangle with dimensions `l` and `b`.

### Input:
- You are given the choice `ch` and an array `a`:
  - If `ch = 1`, `a` contains a single number `r` (radius of the circle).
  - If `ch = 2`, `a` contains two numbers: `l` (length) and `b` (breadth) of the rectangle.

### Task:
- Return the area calculated based on the choice `ch`, formatted to 5 decimal places.

---

### Code:

```python
from typing import List

def areaSwitchCase(ch: int, a: List[float]) -> str:
    if ch == 1:
        r = a[0]
        area = 3.141592653589793 * r * r
        return "{:.5f}".format(area)
    elif ch == 2:
        l = a[0]
        b = a[1]
        area = l * b
        return "{:.5f}".format(area)
