Problem Statement:
Programming languages have some conditional/decision-making statements that execute when a specific condition is fulfilled.

Switch-case is one of the ways to implement them.

In a menu-driven program, the user is given a set of choices to do (the menu) and is asked to select a menu item.

There are 2 choices in the menu:

Choice 1 is to find the area of a circle having radius 'r'.
Choice 2 is to find the area of a rectangle having dimensions 'l' and 'b'.
You are given the choice ch and an array a:

If ch is 1, a contains a single number r.
If ch is 2, a contains 2 numbers l and b

CODE:
from typing import List

def areaSwitchCase(ch: int, a: List[float]) -> str:
    if ch == 1:
        r = a[0]
        area = 3.141592653589793 * r * r
        return "{:.5f}".format(area)
    elif ch == 2:
        l = a[0]
        b = a[1]
        area = l * b
        return "{:.5f}".format(area)
