Problem statement
You are given a sorted array ‘arr’ containing ‘n’ integers and an integer ‘x’.Implement the ‘upper bound’ function to find the index of the upper bound of 'x' in the array.
CODE:
def upperBound(arr: [int], x: int, n: int) -> int:
    low, high = 0, n
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] > x:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid + 1
    return low
