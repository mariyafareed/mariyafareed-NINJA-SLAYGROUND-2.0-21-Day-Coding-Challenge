Problem statement
You are given an integer N. Your task is to return a 2-D ArrayList containing the pascalâ€™s triangle till the row N.

A Pascal's triangle is a triangular array constructed by summing adjacent elements in preceding rows. Pascal's triangle contains the values of the binomial coefficient.
CODE:
from collections import *
from math import *

def printPascal(n: int):
    triangle = []
    for i in range(n):
        row = [1] * (i + 1)
        for j in range(1, i):
            row[j] = triangle[i - 1][j - 1] + triangle[i - 1][j]
        triangle.append(row)
    return triangle
