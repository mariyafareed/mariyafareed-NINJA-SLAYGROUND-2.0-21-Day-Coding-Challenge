Problem statement
You are given a matrix 'MATRIX' of dimension 'N' x 'M'. Your task is to make all the elements of row 'i' and column 'j' equal to 0 if any element in the ith row or jth column of the matrix is 0.

Note:

1) The number of rows should be at least 1.

2) The number of columns should be at least 1.
CODE:

from math import *

def zeroMatrix(matrix, n, m):
    first_row_zero = any(matrix[0][j] == 0 for j in range(m))
    first_col_zero = any(matrix[i][0] == 0 for i in range(n))
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(1, m):
            if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                matrix[i][0] = 0
                matrix[0][j] = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(1, m):
            if matrix[i][0] == 0 or matrix[0][j] == 0:
                matrix[i][j] = 0
    if first_row_zero:
        for j in range(m):
            matrix[0][j] = 0
    if first_col_zero:
        for i in range(n):
            matrix[i][0] = 0
    return matrix
