Problem statement
Sam want to read exactly ‘TARGET’ number of pages.
He has an array ‘BOOK’ containing the number of pages for ‘N’ books.
Return YES/NO, if it is possible for him to read any 2 books and he can meet his ‘TARGET’ number of pages.

CODE:
def read(n: int, book: [int], target: int) -> str:
    seen = set()  # To store the pages of books we have already seen
    
    for pages in book:
        complement = target - pages
        if complement in seen:
            return "YES"
        seen.add(pages)
    
    return "NO"
