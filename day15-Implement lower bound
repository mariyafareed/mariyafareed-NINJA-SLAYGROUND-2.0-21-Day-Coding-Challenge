Problem statement
You are given an array 'arr' sorted in non-decreasing order and a number 'x'. You must return the index of the lower bound of 'x'.
code:
def lowerBound(arr: [int], n: int, x: int) -> int:
    left, right = 0, n
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] < x:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid
    return left
